Jose worked with the LaRouche Movement from the time he was 16 years-old, and helped organize concerts, youth choruses, and science programs where young people between the ages of 12-18 were taught the ideas of Johannes Kepler, Albert Einstein, and Bernard Riemann. Since then, Jose has intervened against a number of political figures, economists, and think-tank leaders, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mike Pompeo, Kamala Harris, Ritchie Torres, Hakeem Jeffries, and the editors of the New York Times, Reuters, and the Washington Post."
about_paragraph2 = "Jose ran against Ritchie Torres in the 2024 election as an independent candidate in NY-15. He is running again to bring an end to the two-party system in the U.S. which has brought us nothing but forever wars and financial bailouts. Jose was raised in the South Bronx, and believes that true change can come from people realizing the better traditions of the U.S. Republic. Jose believes the United States must once again become a beacon of hope and temple of liberty to the world, and join hands with the Global Majority represented by the BRICS+, SCO, ASEAN, and other global institutions which are promoting true economic development for their nations."
