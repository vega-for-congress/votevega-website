Today, I'm thinking about the senseless death and tragedy that happened 24 years ago. 3 Thousand innocent lives taken. 

And the response of our government, which we now know, thanks to whistleblowers like William Binney and Kirk Wiebe, was to use that tragedy to endlessly fund intelligence agencies to mass surveil Americans. 

And worst of all, to continue the mass death of countries abroad and pretend to be an imperialist power.

And now here we are again. What role did agencies play in Charlie Kirk's death? Why are there Ukrainians celebrating the death of Kirk? Was Charlie really changing his direction on Israel?

These questions, while they have answers, pale in comparison to what is about to happen.

Palantir and other surveillance companies are now about to explicitly go after any pro Palestinian, leftist organization, congressional campaign etc. You will be infiltrated, manipulated and definitely spied on. 

I would just ask that you keep in mind that this is no longer about 'left and right'. There is something rotten in our country and it isn't each other. The answer to why Charlie Kirk had to be killed will lie within our Intelligence agencies. They can pretend not to know who the killer is. 

But the truth is, as we know from people like Edward Snowden, the NSA spies on literally every American and every cellphone device. You're telling me the NSA can't just pull the metadata from every device that day? Or browse through google searches of people in the area and see what they were looking up? That's what they'll argue at least. And that's why Palantir will play a bigger role in surveillance. They'll argue it's for safety. That the 'left' is out of control. That someone needs to monitor the 'violent' organization

I know there are many MAGA people that follow me because of my interventions in the past. I would ask that you do not place the blame upon your neighbors. This came directly from the up and ups.

it's time to absolve the 'left, right' dynamic in this country. There's a hostile force in our government that is going to continue to carry out these kinds of assassinations. 

As for Charlie Kirk, I genuinely mourn his death and I think of the two kids now left without a father. Just like I think about the thousands of Palestinian children all left without parents. The biggest victims in all the political violence and assassinations is not the victim, but the young generation that is being raised and born in this culture. 

I was almost 3 years old when 9/11 happened. And my entire childhood up to today has been defined by living in a country perpetuating endless war and death in other countries.

We have to end this cycle. We can't continue it. The more you cheer on his death, the more the cycle of violence continues. As sincere as you feel about him being a fascist, nazi, etc, there is someone who feels just as sincere about you being a 'terrorist, extremist, sharia law' supporter.
